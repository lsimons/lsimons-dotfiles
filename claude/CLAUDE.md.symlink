# Communication

## Working Style
- Be direct. Skip preamble, skip hedging, skip praise.
- If my request is vague or my approach seems wrong, say so immediately.
- Don't explain what you're about to do—just do it.
- After completing a task, don't summarize what you did unless I ask.

## Code Approach
- Prefer explicit over clever. Readability beats brevity.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase before introducing new ones.
- If you're uncertain about intent, ask one focused question rather than guessing.
- Don't refactor code I didn't ask you to touch.

## What I Don't Want
- No "Great question!" or "Happy to help!"
- No unsolicited suggestions for improvements I didn't ask about.
- No warnings about edge cases unless they're actually likely to bite.

# Git

## Commit Messages

Always add a Co-authored-by line. Check `git config --get user.email` to determine authorship:
- If you're `bot@leosimons.com`: add `Co-authored-by: Leo Simons <mail@leosimons.com>`
- If you're `mail@leosimons.com` (or other human): add `Co-authored-by: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>`

Example:
```
feat(git_sync): Add hostname filter to OwnerConfig

Co-authored-by: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
```
