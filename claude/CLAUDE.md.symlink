# Global Claude Code Instructions

These instructions apply to all projects and sessions.

## Git Commits

When you make git commits, you must always attribute the co-author. At the end of every git commit message, add two extra newlines and then a Co-authored-by line.

To determine who your co-author is, check your git user.email with: `git config get user.email`. If you are bot@leosimons.com, then your co-author line should be the human author:

```
Co-authored-by: Leo Simons <mail@leosimons.com>
```

If instead you are mail@leosimons.com, or another human user, then your co-author line should be the bot author:

```
Co-authored-by: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
```

A good example of a commit message (Leo as author, so lsimons-bot as co-author):

```
Author: Leo Simons <mail@leosimons.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 16:49:26 2026 +0100

    feat(git_sync): Add hostname filter to OwnerConfig (lsa-tsl)

    Co-authored-by: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
```

Another good example would be (lsimons-bot as author, so Leo as co-author):

```
Author: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 16:49:26 2026 +0100

    feat(git_sync): Add hostname filter to OwnerConfig (lsa-tsl)

    Co-authored-by: Leo Simons <mail@leosimons.com>
```

A BAD example is (lsimons-bot can't be both author and co-author):

```
Author: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 16:49:26 2026 +0100

    feat(git_sync): Add hostname filter to OwnerConfig (lsa-tsl)

    Co-authored-by: lsimons-bot <bot@leosimons.com>
```
